## Overview

### The Challenge

- Create a turtle crossing game using the Turtle module.
- Game functionality includes:
  - Set up the screen
  - Move the turtle upwards with the arrow key
  - Generate moving cars from right to left
  - Detect collisions between the turtle and cars and end the game
  - Detect when the turtle reaches the finish line, then reset turtle and increase level
  - Implement a scoreboard that increases level count each time the turtle finishes a round


## My Process

### Built With

- Python üêç
- Turtle Module üê¢

### What I Learned

- Object-Oriented Programming:
  - Class constructors, object instantiation
  - Inheritance and method overriding
- Collision detection using Turtle coordinates
- Game loop structure with animation
- Managing screen updates with `screen.tracer()` and `screen.update()`
- Creating simple level progression and scoreboard updates
