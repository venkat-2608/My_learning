## Overview

### The challenge

- Create a classic Snake game using the Turtle module in Python.
- This is Part 1 of the game:
  - Create the snake body
  - Move the snake forward automatically
  - Add keyboard controls for user interaction using arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right)

## My process

### Built with

- Python  
- Turtle module

### What I learned

- How to create and animate multiple segments using **Turtle**
- Use of **OOP**: custom classes and methods
- Use of `screen.tracer(0)` to control rendering
- Use of `screen.update()` to manually refresh the screen each frame
- Use of the **time module** (`time.sleep(0.1)`) to create delays for smooth animation
- Handling **keyboard events** using `screen.onkey()` and `screen.listen()`
