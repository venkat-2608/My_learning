## 🔍 Overview

### 🎯 The Challenge

Build a simple "choose your own adventure" style treasure hunt game using Python. The game should respond to user input and navigate through multiple decision points.

---

### ✅ Why This Project Matters

This project fully demonstrates all the concepts covered on **Day 3** of Angela Yu’s _100 Days of Code_ course. It covers:
- Writing conditional logic using `if`, `elif`, and `else`
- Using logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`)
- Understanding and applying indentation and code blocks

It serves as a complete and interactive reflection of all Day 3 exercises and lessons.

## ⚙️ My Process

### 🧰 Built With

- Python (Day 3 topics: conditionals, logic, and input handling)

---

### 🧠 What I Learned

- Writing conditional statements using `if`, `elif`, `else`
- Comparing strings and handling user input with `.lower()`
- Using logical operators (`and`, `or`) to control game flow
- Structuring readable code using proper indentation (code blocks)
- Building simple text-based games

---

## 📝 Notes

- This is the final project for **Day 3** of Angela Yu's *100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2022*.
- The game is fully interactive and allows the player to make decisions that lead to winning or losing scenarios based on logic flow.
