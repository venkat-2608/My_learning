- Python
- pandas library

### What I learned

- List Comprehension for transforming user input into a list
- Dictionary Comprehension to map letters to code words from a DataFrame
- Reading CSV files using `pandas.read_csv()`
- Iterating through DataFrames using `.iterrows()`
- String manipulation and validation with `.upper()` and conditional checks
