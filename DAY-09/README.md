## 🔍 Overview

### 🎯 The Challenge

Create a Python-based **silent auction** program where users can place bids secretly. The program should collect all bids, store them in a dictionary, and determine the highest bidder without revealing previous entries.

---

### ✅ Why This Project Matters

This project covers all the topics taught in **Day 9** of Angela Yu’s *100 Days of Code* course and is sufficient to demonstrate everything taught, including exercises and tutorials. It showcases:
- Dictionary creation and manipulation
- User input and loops
- Writing and calling functions
- Conditional logic
- Using `clear()` to simulate secrecy between users

## ⚙️ My Process

### 🧰 Built With

- Python

---

### 🧠 What I Learned

- How to create and use **dictionaries** to store key-value pairs
- How to use the `max()` function with `key=dict.get` to find the highest value
- Function creation and calling (`all_bidders()`)
- Conditional loops using `while`
- How to handle repeated user input until a condition is met
- How to simulate user privacy using `clear()` from `replit`

---

## 📝 Notes

- Utilized tools like [Python Tutor](https://pythontutor.com/) for understanding control flow and debugging.
- This was a great exercise in thinking about modular and scalable input handling logic.
