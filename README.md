# Final Projects – 100 Days of Code: Python Bootcamp by Angela Yu

Hello,

This is a repository of my final projects for **Angela Yu's 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023**. I have completed up to **Day 35**, focusing on the core Python fundamentals, automation, GUI apps, and API integration.

I decided to pause the course at this point in order to focus more deeply on **Machine Learning**. Based on my personalized learning plan (see my ML learning charts shared in ChatGPT), I’m now transitioning into **Jose Portilla’s “Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp”** on Udemy to build a strong foundation in data science and ML tools.

This repository is a work in progress as I upload finished projects for reference. Thank you for visiting!

## Moving Forward: Machine Learning

From Day 36 onwards, I am shifting my focus to **Machine Learning**, following a structured path:

- **Course**: Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp by Jose Portilla
- **Tools to Master**:
  - NumPy
  - Pandas
  - Matplotlib & Seaborn
  - Scikit-learn
  - Data preprocessing & modeling
  - Supervised & unsupervised learning

This transition is part of my goal to build **2–3 medium-scale ML projects** and gain confidence before the next semester.

Stay tuned for my ML projects in a separate repository!
