## Overview

This project covers all the Day 31 topics and is sufficient to demonstrate everything taught, including exercises and tutorials.

### The challenge

- Create a flash card program to learn words from a specific language.
- Flip the card after 3 seconds to show the translation.
- Keep track of words learned by saving only the remaining ones.
- Handle missing files or data gracefully using exception handling.

## My process

### Built with

- Python
- Tkinter
- pandas

### What I reviewed

- Exception handling with `try`, `except`, and `finally`
- Reading and writing CSV files using `pandas.read_csv()` and `DataFrame.to_csv()`
- File path handling and conditional logic
- GUI building with `Tkinter` including canvas, images, and buttons
- Automating timed events using `window.after()` and `window.after_cancel()`
- Data persistence and user progress tracking using CSV files
