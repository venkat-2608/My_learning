## 🔍 Overview

### 🎯 The Challenge

Build a text-based Blackjack game where:
- The user and computer are each dealt two cards.
- The user can choose to draw more cards.
- The computer draws cards until it reaches at least 16.
- The game evaluates wins/losses based on standard Blackjack rules.
- Aces (11 or 1) are handled dynamically to prevent busting.

### ✅ Why This Project Matters

This project covers all the topics taught in **Day 11** of Angela Yu’s *100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2022*. It demonstrates:
- Function composition and modular design
- Working with `random.choice()` and dynamic lists
- Logical conditions to simulate a card game
- Handling edge cases (like Blackjack or bust scenarios)
- Use of recursion and loops for game flow

This is a **capstone project** and is sufficient to demonstrate all concepts from Day 11, including tutorials and exercises.

## ⚙️ My Process

### 🧰 Built With

- Python
- `random` module
- Custom game loop
- Conditional logic and recursion

---

### 🧠 What I Learned

- Simulating a real-world card game with logic and Python
- Handling dynamic scoring with Aces in Blackjack
- Writing functions that use lists and control game state
- Recursion vs loops for continuous play
- Defensive programming: anticipating input and game flow issues

---

## 📝 Notes

- This is my **initial implementation** of the Blackjack game. I plan to review and improve it, especially the logic for Ace handling and game replay.
- The use of recursion to restart the game could be optimized later with loop-based design.
