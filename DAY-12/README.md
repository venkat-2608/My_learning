## 🔍 Overview

### 🎯 The Challenge

- Create a text-based game to guess a number between 1 and 100.
- Provide two difficulty levels: easy (10 attempts) and hard (5 attempts).
- Reduce attempts and guide user based on high/low guesses.

### ✅ Why This Project Matters

This project covers all the **Day 12** topics and is sufficient to demonstrate everything taught, including exercises and tutorials. It shows how to manage:
- Variable scope
- Function arguments and returns
- Game loops and conditional logic
- Constants and cleaner code structure

## ⚙️ My Process

### 🧰 Built With

- Python
- Random module
- Functions

---

### 🧠 What I Learned

- How to use and manage **namespaces**
- The difference between **local and global scope**
- Safely modifying global variables using return values
- Defining **Python constants** and using them in a clean way
- Constructing simple game logic with loops and conditions

---

## 🗒️ Notes

- Visualized program flow using: [Python Tutor](https://pythontutor.com/visualize.html#mode=edit)
- Clean structure and logic made debugging easier.
