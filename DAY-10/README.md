## 🔍 Overview

### 🎯 The Challenge

Build a text-based calculator that:
- Accepts user input for numbers and operations
- Uses defined functions for mathematical operations
- Allows continuous calculations using previous results
- Restarts from the beginning based on user choice

---

### ✅ Why This Project Matters

This project covers all the Day 10 topics taught in **Angela Yu’s 100 Days of Code: Python Bootcamp** and is sufficient to demonstrate everything covered, including exercises and tutorials. It solidifies understanding of:
- Functions with outputs
- Looping structures and recursion
- Returning values instead of printing directly
- Function dictionaries for dynamic behavior

## ⚙️ My Process

### 🧰 Built With

- Python

---

### 🧠 What I Learned

- How to define and return values from functions
- The difference between `print()` and `return`
- How to use a dictionary to call functions dynamically
- Looping with `while` and restarting with recursion
- How to manage state during repeated calculations

---

## 📝 Notes

- This calculator is fully functional via the terminal.
- It uses recursion and loop flags for clean user control.
