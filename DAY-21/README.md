## Overview

### The Challenge

- Continue building on the Snake game created in Day 20.
- Implement key features:
  - Detect collision with food and extend snake length.
  - Create a scoreboard that updates with each food eaten.
  - Detect collision with the wall and reset the game.
  - Detect collision with the tail (self-collision) and reset the game.

## My Process

### Built With

- Python
- Turtle module

### What I Learned

- Class inheritance to reuse and extend functionality.
- How to detect collisions using `.distance()` method.
- Game reset logic for collisions.
- Slicing lists to skip the head of the snake while checking self-collision.
- Tuples for position handling.
