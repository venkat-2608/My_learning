## 🔍 Overview

### 🎯 The Challenge

Build a Rock, Paper, Scissors game in Python that allows user input, uses randomization for the computer's move, and handles all outcomes with appropriate win/loss/tie logic.

---

### ✅ Why This Project Matters

This project covers all the topics taught in **Day 4** of Angela Yu’s _100 Days of Code_ course. It demonstrates:
- Use of the `random` module
- Working with Python lists (including nested lists)
- Index access and error handling

The project is sufficient to replicate and demonstrate all Day 4 tutorials and exercises effectively.

## ⚙️ My Process

### 🧰 Built With

- Python (Day 4 concepts)

---

### 🧠 What I Learned

- Importing and using the `random` module to simulate unpredictable choices
- Creating and using Python lists
- Accessing list elements by index
- Understanding and handling `IndexError`
- Representing and printing ASCII art in a clean and readable way
- Structuring logic using conditional (`if`, `elif`, `else`) statements

---

## 📝 Notes

- This is the final project for **Day 4** of Angela Yu's *100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2022*.
- The game logic includes win, lose, and tie conditions, and validates interaction between user and computer choices using indexed list values.
