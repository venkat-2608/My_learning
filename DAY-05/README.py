## 🔍 Overview

### 🎯 The Challenge

Create a Python-based password generator that allows users to define how many letters, symbols, and numbers the password should contain, then randomly generates and shuffles a secure password accordingly.

---

### ✅ Why This Project Matters

This project covers all the topics taught in **Day 5** of Angela Yu’s *100 Days of Code* course. It demonstrates:
- Using `for` loops and `range()`
- Random selection from lists
- Combining and shuffling lists
- String manipulation

The project is sufficient to demonstrate everything taught in Day 5, including all exercises and tutorials.

## ⚙️ My Process

### 🧰 Built With

- Python (Day 5 concepts)

---

### 🧠 What I Learned

- How to use `for` loops to repeat tasks
- How to use `range()` for iteration control
- How to use lists to store and manage data (letters, numbers, symbols)
- How to use `random.randint()` and `random.shuffle()`
- String and list operations for generating a final password
- Basic understanding of randomness and user input handling

## 📝 Notes

- This is the final project for **Day 5** of Angela Yu’s *100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2022*.
- This version adds randomness, interactivity, and list manipulation to generate complex, secure passwords.
