## Overview

### The challenge

- Build a functional Etch A Sketch using the Turtle module and keyboard controls:
  - `W`: Move forward
  - `S`: Move backward
  - `A`: Rotate counter-clockwise
  - `D`: Rotate clockwise
  - `C`: Clear the screen and reset

## My process

### Built with

- Python  
- Turtle module

### What I learned

- Using **event listeners** to handle keyboard inputs (`onkey()`, `listen()`)
- Controlling turtle movement with custom key bindings
- Writing clean and reusable **functions**
- Understanding how to manipulate the **Turtle** graphics environment
