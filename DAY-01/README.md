## 🔍 Overview

### 🎯 The Challenge

Create a simple Python program that generates a band name using user inputs like the city you grew up in and a favorite item.

---

### ✅ Why This Project Matters

This project is sufficient to cover all the core concepts taught on **Day 1** of Angela Yu's course. It includes:
- Printing to the console
- Receiving user input
- Creating and using variables
- String concatenation and formatting

Together, these reflect all tutorials and exercises provided in Day 1, making this a complete hands-on summary.

## ⚙️ My Process

### 🧰 Built With

- Python (basic syntax and input/output handling)

---

### 🧠 What I Learned

- `print()` statements
- Writing and using comments
- Debugging simple syntax issues
- Storing user input in variables
- String manipulation using `+` and `.capitalize()`

## 📝 Notes

- This is the final project for **Day 1** of Angela Yu's *100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2022*.
- I made a small customization:
  - Instead of asking for a pet’s name, I used a favorite **food**.
  - Used `.capitalize()` to improve the band name’s formatting.
