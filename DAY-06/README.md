## 🔍 Overview

### 🎯 The Challenge

Guide a robot in **Reeborg’s World** to escape a randomly generated maze using Python logic. The robot must follow walls and make decisions based on its surroundings using sensors.

---

### ✅ Why This Project Matters

This project covers all the topics taught in **Day 6** of Angela Yu’s *100 Days of Code* course. It demonstrates:
- Creating and calling custom functions
- Looping with `while not at_goal()`
- Using conditionals with multiple branches
- Logical thinking and control flow
- Working with a visual Python simulation

The project is sufficient to demonstrate everything taught in Day 6, including all exercises and tutorials.

## ⚙️ My Process

### 🧰 Built With

- Python (Day 6 concepts)
- [Reeborg’s World Simulator](https://reeborg.ca)

---

### 🧠 What I Learned

- How to define reusable functions like `turn_right()` and `stay_right()`
- How to use `while` loops for continuous checks
- Conditional logic with `if`, `elif`, and `else`
- Wall-following algorithms and maze-solving strategy
- Importance of clean indentation and structure in Python

---

## 📝 Notes

- This is the final project for **Day 6** of Angela Yu’s *100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2022*.
- The robot might not handle every edge case perfectly, but it works for most randomized mazes.
- This project helped build confidence in using loops and logic-based navigation.
